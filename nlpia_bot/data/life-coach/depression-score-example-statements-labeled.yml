# Depression Sentiment Analysis Training set
# from Feeling Good from David D. Burns, M.D.
# Depression self-assessment on p. 20-22
#
# Idea:
#   - volunteers, students, mentees to populate this list with paraphrases.
#   - check sentiment and semantics of paraphrasings using USE to ensure proximity to "reference sentence" and rank, human review of any outliers and mislabels by volunteers
#   - could be a game to try to trick the bot where you provide a score and a statement and have the bot rate you and if it is way off you get a point based on how far off it is. jackpot is oposite sentiment/sarcasm.
#   - game could use earlier version of algorithm (like using word2vec/spacy doc vectors) and labels could be taken as truth if they meet USE or BERT-based label, while they could be curated if they do not.
