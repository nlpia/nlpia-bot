# # Data Science for Digital Health Glossary
# To make room for new concepts we compress complex concepts into words.
# And then we can compress several words into acronyms to consolidate multiple complex concepts under one "umbrella" concept.
# Smart people can think analogously across domains, sharing words and concepts and brain neurons between domains.
Endogenous variable: "A variable is said to be endogenous within a causal model if its value is determined or influenced by one or more of the independent variables driving the model predictions. This may also sometimes be referred to as the outcome variable or the output of a causal model. See Also: *target variable*, *predicted variable*, *dependent variable* #data-science"
Exogenous variable: "A variable is said to be exogenous for a causal model if its value influences or determines the independent or endogenous variables. These exogenous variables may or may not be measured or controled for and if they are not they are call confounding variables or confounders.  #data-science"
confounder: [confounding variable]
confounding variable: "An independent or feature variable that is not accounted for in your model but has an affect on your target variable. See Also: *confounder* #data-science"
target variable: "The dependent variable or the variable you want to predict using a data science or machine learning model. See Also: *target* #data-science"

dependent variable: [endogenous variable, predicted variable, target variable, target]
predicted variable: [dependent variable, endogenous variable, target variable, target]
probability: The likelihood that an even will occur. The proportion of events that would result in one particular outcome in the limit as the number of trials (events such as dice rolling) approaches infinity. #statistics #data-science
complementary rule: "The idea that the probability of one even is equal to one minus the probability of it's complement (logical oposite). In math: P(A) = 1 - P(not A)."
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): "Also called standard error. RMSE is the sum of squared error between predictions and true values divided by the number of predictions and then the square root of that average squared error.  In python: `np.sqrt((np.mean(predictions - true_values) ** 2)`. It is also equivalent to the square root of the dot product of the error vector with itself divided by the number of predictions: `np.sqrt(np.dot(predictions - true_values, predictions - true_values) / len(predictions))`. If you replace the `true_values` in this equation with `0` RMSE is equivalent to the standard deviation. #data-science #statistics #machine-learning"
Mean Square Error (MSE): "Also called error variance. MSE is the sqaure of RMSE. It is sum of squared error between predictions and true values divided by the number of predictions.  In python (numpy): `np.mean(predictions - true_values) ** 2)`. It is also equivalent to the dot product of the error vector with itself: `np.dot(predictions - true_values, predictions - true_values) / len(predictions)` If you replace the `true_values` in either of these equations with the constant value `0`, MSE is equivalent to the variance. #data-science #statistics #machine-learning"

Random Access Memory (RAM): "Physical solid state memory chips (packages of transistors) within your computer that retain the information stored there only while a computer is powered on. Also sometimes called main memory to distinguish it from the memory cache within your CPU chip. RAM memory is erased when your computer is powered off. RAM can be read and written to quickly (faster than any other memory) at any location without delay for locating the desired position within RAM where the data is located. RAM is the fastest source of memory for working with data, but it is also the most expensive and so it is usually the limiting factor for a computer used in data science."
Flash: "Physical solid-state memory chips that retain the information stored there when powered off. Seek and read operations (finding a location on within memory and reading it it) are almost as fast as for RAM, but write operations (changing the information stored at a particular location) take much more time than for RAM. When used for persistent storage like a hard drive it is often called a Solid State Drive (SSD). Flash transistors at each memory location within flash memory have a limited lifetime of write operations that they can perform (typically in the thousands) before failing. Modern operating systems distribute the"
