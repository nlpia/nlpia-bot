#   - To make room for new concepts we compress complex concepts into words.
#   - And then we can compress several words into acronyms to consolidate multiple complex concepts under one "umbrella" concept.
#   - Smart people can think analogously across domains, sharing words and concepts and brain neurons between domains.

"F-value": "A measure of how statistically significant and reliable a multivariate linear regression model will be in the future. It is computed by dividing the explained variance (variance of the predictions) by the unexplained variance (variance of the residuals or errors). It is often used in conjunction with the R-squared correlation coefficient which measures the strength of the model in predicting the outcome or response variable."
Residuals: "The error in a prediction. It is computed by subtracting the true value from the predicted value. #data-science"
Endogenous variable: "A variable is said to be endogenous within a causal model if its value is determined or influenced by one or more of the independent variables driving the model predictions. This may also sometimes be referred to as the outcome variable or the output of a causal model. See Also: *target variable*, *predicted variable*, *dependent variable* #data-science"
Exogenous variable: "A variable is said to be exogenous for a causal model if its value influences or determines the independent or endogenous variables. These exogenous variables may or may not be measured or controlled for and if they are not they are call confounding variables or confounders.  #data-science"
confounder: [confounding variable]
confounding variable: "An independent or feature variable that is not accounted for in your model but has an affect on your target variable. See Also: *confounder* #data-science"
target variable: ["The dependent variable or the variable you want to predict using a data science or machine learning model. See Also: *target* #data-science", [data-science, machine-learning, statistics], [target variable, endogenous variable, predicted variable, target variable, target, outcome variable, outcome]]
feature variable: [exogenous variable, predictor variable, feature variable, feature, attribute]
probability: The likelihood that an even will occur. The proportion of events that would result in one particular outcome in the limit as the number of trials (events such as dice rolling) approaches infinity. #statistics #data-science
complementary rule: "The idea that the probability of one even is equal to one minus the probability of it's complement (logical opposite). In math: P(A) = 1 - P(not A)."
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): "Also called standard error. RMSE is the sum of squared error between predictions and true values divided by the number of predictions and then the square root of that average squared error.  In python: `np.sqrt((np.mean(predictions - true_values) ** 2)`. It is also equivalent to the square root of the dot product of the error vector with itself divided by the number of predictions: `np.sqrt(np.dot(predictions - true_values, predictions - true_values) / len(predictions))`. If you replace the `true_values` in this equation with `0` RMSE is equivalent to the standard deviation. #data-science #statistics #machine-learning"
Mean Square Error (MSE): "Also called error variance. MSE is the square of RMSE. It is sum of squared error between predictions and true values divided by the number of predictions.  In python (numpy): `np.mean(predictions - true_values) ** 2)`. It is also equivalent to the dot product of the error vector with itself: `np.dot(predictions - true_values, predictions - true_values) / len(predictions)` If you replace the `true_values` in either of these equations with the constant value `0`, MSE is equivalent to the variance. #data-science #statistics #machine-learning"

Metabolite: "An intermediate product of metabolism, usually small molecules. Metabolism is the process by which the cells of an organism produce and consume fuel for energy, signaling compounds, catalysts in other chemical reactions, or structural molecules for building the cells and organs of the organism. Some waste products of metabolism include nitrogen compounds, water, CO2 (carbon dioxide), phosphates, and sulphates. #biology #healthcare #microbiology"
Goodness of fit: "How well a model's predictions match the true values. In the scikit-learn package this is usually implemented as a `.score()` method on a model that returns the coefficient of determination (R^2 or the square of the Pierson correlation coefficient) between the model predictions and the true values."
phenome: "The sequence of phenomena or chemical reactions and bodily functions and structures that are triggered or built by a sequence of proteins in a biological system."
phoneme: "A phoneme is a unit of sound that audibly distinguishes one word from another in a particular language. For example, in English, the words \"sign\" and \"sine\" are homonyms and share all the same phonemes in the same sequence. However, \"sin\" is pronounced differently because of the short \"O\" phoneme between the \"S\" and hard \"N\" phonemes."
AllMed: "An independent review and utilization management organization responsible for dispositioning health insurance claims for health insurers."
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): "A developmental disorder that affects communication and behavior. It is called a *developmental disorder* because symptoms generally appear in the first two years of life.

Random Access Memory (RAM): "Physical solid state memory chips (packages of transistors) within your computer that retain the information stored there only while a computer is powered on. Also sometimes called main memory to distinguish it from the memory cache within your CPU chip. RAM memory is erased when your computer is powered off. RAM can be read and written to quickly (faster than any other memory) at any location without delay for locating the desired position within RAM where the data is located. RAM is the fastest source of memory for working with data, but it is also the most expensive and so it is usually the limiting factor for a computer used in data science."
Flash: "Physical solid-state memory chips that retain the information stored there when powered off. Seek and read operations (finding a location on within memory and reading it it) are almost as fast as for RAM, but write operations (changing the information stored at a particular location) take much more time than for RAM. When used for persistent storage like a hard drive it is often called a Solid State Drive (SSD). Flash transistors at each memory location within flash memory have a limited lifetime of write operations that they can perform (typically in the thousands) before failing. Modern operating systems distribute the"

This may be due to our finely tuned instinct to read facial expressions and look for signs of illness or psychological instability in the faces of other humans.
